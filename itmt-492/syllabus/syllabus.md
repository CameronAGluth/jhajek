## Course Catalog Description

This course covers reconfigurable intelligent devices programmed with modern high level languages focusing on design and integration to modern environments. The course will also cover the topic and deployment of wireless sensor networks and the use of rapid prototyping for commercial application. Students will discover hardware, software and firmware design trade-offs as well as best practices in current embedded systems development. A final project will integrate course topics into a system using an embeddable single-board microcontroller.

This survey of Smart Technologies will cover small computers (Arduino) and sensors, wireless protocols, AR devices, voice assistants, solar powered and battery back sensor networks and cloud storage will give students a sufficient ability to create innovative solutions to problems they encounter across multiple fields.

## Course Objectives

1. Understand the principles of electricity and electronics that support embedded systems.
2. Understand embedded systems diagrams and electronic symbols.
3. Apply principles of electronics in operating electronic meters and testing voltage, amperage and resistance measurements.
4. Understand the concepts of Data Collection, Data Transmission, and Data presentation using small computers and analogue and digital sensor networks
5. Understand how to use and deploy wireless communication standards: Bluetooth, NFC, xBee 802.15
6. Understand the concepts and how to deploy solar panels and LiPo batteries
7. Understand the basics of cloud data storage for smart technology
8. Understand the basics of Augmented Reality devices
9. Understand how to use and integrate voice assistants to project solutions

### Readings

NA

### Course Notes

It is recommended to take notes from the discussion portion of the class.

### Attendance

Undergrad attendance is expected and will be counted as part of your grade -- if you are not able to attend please email me

### Course Web Site

[http://blackboard.iit.edu/](http://blackboard.iit.edu/ "Course Document Mangement Site URL")

The course will make use of Blackboard [http://blackboard.iit.edu/](http://blackboard.iit.edu/ "Course Document Mangement Site URL") for communications, assignment submissions, group project coordination, providing online resources and administering examinations. All remote students will view the course lectures online via Blackboard, and online readings and other course material will be found on Blackboard.

### Assignments

There will be 4 mini-projects and 1 Final Project -- no Final Exam.

* Electronics Presentation
  * A short 5 minute presentation explaining the workings and history of an electronic component and an example of where it is used
* Data Collection
  * Small project integrating multiple sensors and code to collect sensor data.  Example would be to create a copy of the [game Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game) "Simon Game")
* Data Transmission
  * Using wireless technologies, demonstrate how to transmit and receive data over a wireless protocol
* Data Presentation
  * Using a cloud presentation platform, connect your sensor data to be collected and displayed on a platform.
* Final Project
  * Integrate aspects of all three: Data Collection, Data Presentation, and Data Transmission, in a self designed project.  Could be team or individual based pending instructor approval.

### Grading

Grading criteria for (undergrad course number) students will be as follows:

Letter | Description | Percentage
-------|-------------|------------
A | Outstanding work reflecting substantial effort | 90-100%

### Late Submission

By default no late work will be accepted â€“ barring situations beyond our control.

### Academic Honesty

All work you submit in this course must be your own.

### Plagiarism

Dealing with code -- you need to respect opensource licenses and in the absence of a clear license be careful cutting and pasting code without attributing source. A good metric would be to add a comment in your code with a link to the original source to protect yourself.

This class won't be dealing with formal written papers.

### Our Contract

This syllabus is my contract with you as to what I will deliver and what I expect from you. If I change the syllabus, I will issue a revised version of the syllabus; the latest version will always be available on Blackboard. Revisions to readings and assignments will be communicated via Blackboard and via version control in GitHub

### Disabilities

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities.  In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources and make an appointment to speak with me as soon as possible.  My office hours are listed on the first page of the syllabus. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in 3424 S. State St., room 1C3-2 (on the first floor), telephone 312 567.5744 or disabilities@iit.edu

### ARC Tutoring Center

The university provides a free tutoring and study center called the [ARC](https://www.iit.edu/arc "IIT Resource Center URL").  This is located newly in the basement of the Galvin Library and is open to all for walk in appointments as well as scheduled tutoring.

### Illinois Tech Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information

Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender discrimination by any member of our community. This includes harassment among students, staff, or faculty. Sexual harassment of a student by a faculty member or sexual harassment of an employee by a supervisor is particularly serious. Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.

Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for information on support options and the resolution process. You can report sexual harassment electronically at [iit.edu/incidentreport](iit.edu/incidentreport "IIT Incident Report URL"), which may be completed anonymously. You may additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster at foster@iit.edu or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator, Esther Espeland at eespeland@iit.edu.

For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Techâ€™s Confidential Advisor at (773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed practitioner in Illinois Techâ€™s Student Health and Wellness Center at student.health@iit.edu or (312)567-7550

For a comprehensive list of resources regarding counseling services, medical assistance, legal assistance and visa and immigration services, you can visit the Office of Title IX Compliance website at [https://www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources](https://www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources "IIT Title IX resources").

### COVID-19 Precautions and Face Coverings in Class

Illinois Tech students are required to be vaccinated, to have a booster as soon as you are eligible, and to wear face masks at all times when indoors. In general, individuals should spend as little time as practicable in closer proximity when doing so is necessary to achieve learning objectives. Students who are feeling ill or experiencing symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, or a higher than normal temperature will be excused from class and are expected to stay at home.

Instructors have the right to ask those who are not complying with these requirements to leave class in the interest of everyone's health and safety. In the event that a student refuses to comply with instructor directions regarding face masks, the instructor has the right to ask the student to leave, and/or cancel class. A student who refuses to comply with these requirements will be referred to the Office of the Dean of Students for possible disciplinary action under the Student Code of Conduct.

Additionally, as a reminder, following other simple practices such as frequent and thorough hand washing, wiping down desks and seats with disinfectant wipes when possible, not sharing personal items such as pens and cell phones, and avoiding crowded hallways and other enclosed spaces will promote good health in and out of the classroom.
