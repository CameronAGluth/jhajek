## Questions

1. Consider a packet of length L that begins at end system A and travels over  three links to a destination end system. These three links are connected by  two packet switches. Let di, si, and Ri denote the length, propagation speed, and the transmission rate of link i, for i = 1, 2, 3. The packet switch delays each packet by dproc. Assuming no queuing delays, in terms of di, si, Ri,  (i = 1, 2, 3), and L, what is the total end-to-end delay for the packet? Suppose now the packet is 1,500 bytes, the propagation speed on all three links is  2.5 #108 m/s, the transmission rates of all three links are 2.5 Mbps, the packet  switch processing delay is 3 msec, the length of the first link is 5,000 km, the  length of the second link is 4,000 km, and the length of the last link is 1,000  km. For these values, what is the end-to-end delay?  P11. In the above problem, suppose R1 = R2 = R3 = R.
