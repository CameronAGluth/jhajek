**Course Outcomes:**

The course is a foundation course in the basics of Data Communications and Computer Networks. It is intent is to serve as a basis for practical studies in field of Computer Networking and Network Administration. Upon completion, a student should be able to understand how a Computer Network works from both a practical and theoretical perspective. They should understand OSI & TCP/IP Models, Various Networking Protocols, Data Circuits, Switches, and Routers. They will also have an understanding of troubleshooting and management of networks by usage of various tools.

**Program Educational Objectives:**

* Perform requirements analysis, design and administration of computer and network-based systems conforming to policy and best practices, and monitor and support continuing development of relevant policy and best practices as appropriate.
* Apply current technical and mathematical concepts and practices in the core information technologies and recognize the need to engage in continuing professional development.

**Course Student Outcomes:** Students completing this course will be able to:

* Outline the basics components of a computer network using both the TCP/IP protocol suite and the OSI model.
* Identify the various types of network systems, including local area networks, metropolitan area networks, wide area networks, and voice/data delivery networks.
* Enumerate the various transmission media commonly used in carrier systems, i.e. twisted pair, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, terrestrial microwave, satellite, as well as other wireless technologies.
* Recognize the basics of data communications, including data, signals, conversions between data and signals, encoding techniques, multiplexing, and modulation.
* Identify the various types of error detection and error corrections schemes.
* Identify the basics of T-carrier systems, frame relay, asynchronous transfer mode, DSL, and cable modems, and be able to compare and contrast their characteristics.

* Document the characteristics of local area networks, including hub and switch technologies.
* Complete a case study in which, given a minimum set of requirements, you will recommend wide area network solutions.
* Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions (ABET Computing Criterion 3.1)
* Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline (ABET Computing Criterion 3.2)
* Identify and analyze user needs and take them into account in the selection, creation, evaluation, and administration of computer-based systems (ABET IT Criterion 3.6)

**Readings:** Readings for the class will be assigned from the textbooks; there will be additional reading assigned in the form of online reading. All readings should be done before coming to class on the assigned date, and are mandatory and expected.  Generally if you do the readings you will excel in the course, as the lectures serve as a clarification and explanation of material you should al-ready be familiar with. Completion of reading may be verified by quizzes. Specific readings are assigned by topic above.

**Course Notes:**  It is recommended to take notes from the oral discussion portion of the class.

**Attendance:** Undergrad attendance is expected and will be counted as part of your grade.  

**Course Web Site:** [http://blackboard.iit.edu/](http://blackboard.iit.edu/ "Course Document Mangement Site URL")

**Blackboard:** The course will make intensive use of Blackboard [http://blackboard.iit.edu/](http://blackboard.iit.edu/ "Course Document Mangement Site URL") for communications, assignment submissions, group project coordination, providing online resources and administering examinations. All remote students will view the course lectures online via Blackboard, and online readings and other course material will be found on Blackboard.

**Assignments:**

NA

**Grading:** Grading criteria for (undergrad course number) students will be as follows:

Letter | Description | Percentage

**Late Submission:**  By default no late work will be accepted – barring situations beyond our control.

**Academic Honesty:**  All work you submit in this course must be your own.

**Plagiarism:** You must fully attribute all material directly quoted in papers and you must document all sources used in the preparation of the paper using complete, APA-style bibliographic entries. Including directly quoted material in an assignment without attribution or a bibliography entry for the source of the material is always plagiarism and will always be treated as such by me. No more than thirty-three percent of material included in any paper may be direct quotes. Students have submitted plagiarized material in seven of the last eight times I have taught this course and I will not tolerate it. If you submit plagiarized material you WILL receive a grade of ZERO for the assignment or exam question, an Academic Honesty Violation Report will be filed, and it may result in your expulsion from the course with a failing grade as per the IIT and ITM academic honesty policies. There is no excuse for not understanding this policy and if you do not understand it please let me know and I will be happy to discuss it with you until you do.

**Collaboration:** Students may only collaborate on assignments or projects that are explicitly designated as group assignments or projects. Students submitting work that is identical or in some cases even substantively the same will be asked to discuss the assignment with me. If one student admits to having copied the work, or if there is clear evidence who is guilty, the guilty student will be assigned a grade of zero. If no one admits to the offense or a reasonable determination of guilt cannot be made, each student involved will be assigned a grade of zero. In either case, an Academic Honesty Violation Report will be filed, and it may result in your expulsion from the course with a failing grade as per the IIT and ITM academic honesty policies.

**Our Contract:** This syllabus is my contract with you as to what I will deliver and what I expect from you. If I change the syllabus, I will issue a revised version of the syllabus; the latest version will always be available on Blackboard. Revisions to readings and assignments will be communicated via Blackboard.

**Disabilities:** Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities.  In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources and make an appointment to speak with me as soon as possible.  My office hours are listed on the first page of the syllabus. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in 3424 S. State St., room 1C3-2 (on the first floor), telephone 312 567.5744 or disabilities@iit.edu.

**ARC Tutoring Center:** The university provides a free tutoring and study center called the [ARC](https://www.iit.edu/arc "IIT Resource Center URL").  This is located newly in the basement of the Galvin Library and is open to all for walk in appointments as well as scheduled tutoring.

**Illinois Tech’s Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information:** Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender discrimination by any member of our community. This includes harassment among students, staff, or faculty. Sexual harassment of a student by a faculty member or sexual harassment of an employee by a supervisor is particularly serious. Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.

Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for information on support options and the resolution process. You can report sexual harassment electronically at iit.edu/incident report, which may be completed anonymously. You may additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster at foster@iit.edu or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator at eespeland@iit.edu.

For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech’s Confidential Advisor at (773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed practitioner in Illinois Tech’s Student Health and Wellness Center at student.health@iit.edu or (312)567-7550

For a comprehensive list of resources regarding counseling services, medical assistance, legal assistance and visa and immigration services, you can visit the Office of Title IX Compliance website at [https://www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources](https://www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources "Title IX Compliance website").
