### Readings

Readings for the class will be assigned from the textbooks; there will be additional reading assigned in the form of online reading. All readings should be done before coming to class on the assigned date, and are mandatory and expected.  Generally if you do the readings you will excel in the course, as the lectures serve as a clarification and explanation of material you should already be familiar with.

### Course Notes

It is recommended to take notes from the discussion portion of the class.

### Attendance

Attendance is expected and will be counted as part of your grade -- if you are not able to attend please email me / contact on Discord

### Course Web Site

[http://blackboard.iit.edu/](http://blackboard.iit.edu/ "Course Document Mangement Site URL")

The course will make use of Blackboard [http://blackboard.iit.edu/](http://blackboard.iit.edu/ "Course Document Mangement Site URL") for communications, assignment submissions, group project coordination, providing online resources and administering examinations. All remote students will view the course lectures online via Blackboard, and online readings and other course material will be found on Blackboard.

### Assignments

Each week there will a guided review question section and a lab exercise question. There will be 4 larger mini-projects (MPs) a midterm and a final project presentation.

### Grading

Each assignment will be worth the following:

* Weekly review questions: 10pts - x10
* Weekly lab exercises: 10 pts - x10
* Mini Projects - 25 points each x4
* 1 midterm exam - 100 pts
* 1 final project worth 50 points
* Attendance 2 points per class 30 points

Grading criteria for (undergrad course number) students will be as follows:

Letter | Description | Percentage
-------|-------------|------------
A | Outstanding work reflecting substantial effort | 90-100%
B | Excellent work reflecting good effort | 80-89.99%
C | Satisfactory work meeting minimum expectations | 70-79.99%
D | Substandard work not meeting expectations | 60-69.99%
E | Unsatisfactory work |0-59.99%

### Late Submission

By default no late work will be accepted – barring situations beyond our control.

### Academic Honesty

All work you submit in this course must be your own.

### Plagiarism

Dealing with code -- you need to respect opensource licenses and in the absence of a clear license be careful cutting and pasting code without attributing source. A good metric would be to add a comment in your code with a link to the original source to protect yourself.

This class won't be dealing with formal written papers.

### Our Contract

This syllabus is my contract with you as to what I will deliver and what I expect from you. If I change the syllabus, I will issue a revised version of the syllabus; the latest version will always be available on Blackboard. Revisions to readings and assignments will be communicated via Blackboard and via version control in GitHub

### Disabilities

You can report sexual harassment electronically at [iit.edu/incidentreport](iit.edu/incidentreport "IIT Incident Report URL"), which may be completed anonymously. You may additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster at foster@iit.edu or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator, Esther Espeland at eespeland@iit.edu.

For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech’s Confidential Advisor at (773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed practitioner in Illinois Tech’s Student Health and Wellness Center at student.health@iit.edu or (312)567-7550
