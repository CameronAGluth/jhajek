## Objectives

* Explain the concepts of the chapters assigned to your group via a presentation to your classmates
* Explain and discuss the relationship of the topics to your current course work as well as relevant industry work
* Provide study material to help solidify major concepts

## Outcomes

At the conclusion of each team's presentation, each team will have delivered a 30 minute presentation covering the topics and chapters assigned.  You will have highlighted major concepts and themes as well as covered the creation of review material that will be complied into the class final exam.

Your team will provide:

  * Presentation can be pre-recorded or done live
  * Presentation will submitted by the prior Thursday by 5:00 pm to your presentation day and involve a meeting with the professor to cover the material or make any adjustments
  * All team members must participate and speak in the presentation
  * The presentation must clearly cover the main themes of your allotted material and clearly express them
  * Teams will prepare at least 5 review questions of short answer and the answers for these questions
  * Provide three additional slides noting resources involving YouTube presentations from people mentioned in the chapter or based on topics in the chapter

In addition the grading rubric will look like this:

### Project Deliverables

Your team will either do a live or a pre-recorded presentation.  If a pre-recorded, a link to the presentation must be submitted.  Submit which ever notes / presentation platform you have prepared and a second copy with the detailed answers provided to BlackBoard the ~~Friday~~ Thursday by 5:00 PM, so I have time to give you feedback before your Monday's presentation. Then we will meet as a team on Friday morning - you can book an appointment at [https://hajek.youcanbook.me](https://hajek.youcanbook.me "Instructor Booking App") -- Note only one team member has to book a time.

This will be a team grade, but individual submission--each person submits a copy of the material.
