# Virtual Machine Images Deployment Turotial Part 2

This tutorial assumes you have completed the [IT Operations cloud connect tutorial](https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/jhajek/blob/master/itmt-430/IT-Operations-cloud-connect-tutorial/Readme.md "webpage for IT Operations Cloud Connect Tutorial").

## Overview

At the conclusion of this tutorial, you will have deployed 2 virtual machine instances from your Proxmox image templates using [terraform](https://terraform.io "webpage for terraform").

## Setup

The only setup needed is to copy the private key created in the previous tutorial into the directory where the `main.tf` file is located: `terraform` > `proxmox-jammy-ubuntu-front-back-template` > `main.tf`.
