# Tooling Assignment Packer

## Objectives

* Demonstrate the use of Virtual Machines and discuss how they can extend your PCs capabilities
* Discuss the tools used for x86 based Virtualization and Apple Silicon based virtualization
* Examine the benefits of constructing virtual machine text based templates
* Demonstrate using version control in conjunction with text based templates
* Examine and explain the benefits creating custom virtualization artifacts
* Explain the uses and advantages of the Packer platform in relation to virtual machine creation

## Outcomes

At the conclusion of this lab you will have investigated using a virtualization platform (x86 VirtualBox and M1 Parallels) and demonstrated the ability to build your own custom virtualization artifacts.  You will have discussed the advantages of using Packer and Vagrant and you will have implemented and deployed your own custom virtual machine artifacts.

### Packer

Taken from [https://packer.io](https://packer.io "Packer webpage"): Why Packer?

* Multi-provider Portability
  * Identical images allow you to run dev, staging, and production environments across platforms.
* Improved Stability
  * By provisioning instances from stable images installed and configured by Packer, you can ensure buggy software does not get deployed.
* Increased Dev / Production Parity
  * Keep dev, staging, and production environments as similar as possible by generating images for multiple platforms at the same time.
* Reliable Continuous Delivery
  * Generate new machine images for multiple platforms, launch and test, and verify the infrastructure changes work; then, use Terraform to put your images in production.
* Appliance Demo Creation
  * Create software appliances and disposable product demos quickly, even with software that changes continuously.
