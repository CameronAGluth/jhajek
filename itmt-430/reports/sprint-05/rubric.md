Video presentation should demonstrate the following:

Demonstrate that all team members are able to build via Packer and deploy the working site via Vagrant without any manual intervention.  Combine small videos of each member doing just the **final** step of vagrant up for each box (No need to show the building process).  Then continue to show each person open a browser tab and launch the site and log in and or register a user and then log in.

The PM then should demonstrate the use of the variables.json file and show how it was used in your code base to prevent hard-coding of passwords.
